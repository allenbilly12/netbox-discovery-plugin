"""
NAPALM driver auto-detection.

Tries each driver in priority order (Cisco IOS/NX-OS first per preference).
Returns the first driver that successfully connects and calls get_facts().

Each attempt is capped at (timeout + 2) seconds using a background thread so
that drivers with their own internal timeouts (e.g. EOS/pyeapi uses the OS
default HTTP socket timeout of 60 s) cannot stall the crawl.
