"""
BFS (breadth-first search) recursive neighbor crawler.

Starting from seed IPs, connects to each device, collects data,
then enqueues newly discovered neighbor IPs for further processing
up to max_depth levels deep.

Devices are processed in parallel using a thread pool (max_workers).
Django ORM is thread-safe — each thread gets its own DB connection
from the pool automatically.
