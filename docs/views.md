# netbox_discovery/views.py

## Purpose

All Django class-based views for the plugin UI. Covers Discovery Targets, Discovery Runs, and the Duplicate Devices tool.

---

## Duplicate Devices Views

### DuplicateDevicesView (GET /duplicate-devices/)

Lists all NetBox `Device` objects grouped by base hostname (the portion before the first `.`). Groups with more than one device are shown as potential duplicates.

**Context variables:**
- `duplicates` — list of `{base, devices}` dicts
- `duplicate_group_count` — number of groups

### MergeDevicesView (POST /duplicate-devices/merge/)

Merges two devices: keeps one (`keep_id`), copies data from the other (`delete_id`), then deletes the duplicate.

**Merge logic (in order):**
1. **Site**: if keeper is on the holding site and duplicate has a real site, transfer it
2. **Serial**: copy from duplicate if keeper has none
3. **os_version custom field**: copy from duplicate if keeper lacks it
4. **Virtual Chassis**: if duplicate is in a VC and keeper is not, transfer VC membership (position, priority) to keeper
5. If duplicate was the VC master: re-fetch VC from DB, set `vc.master = keeper`
6. Detach duplicate from VC (null out fields) before deletion to avoid `ProtectedError`

**Holding site name** is read from `PLUGINS_CONFIG['netbox_discovery']['holding_site']` (default: `"Holding"`).

### DeleteDuplicateDeviceView (POST /duplicate-devices/<pk>/delete/)

Deletes a single device without merging. Simple POST-only view.

## DiscoveryTarget Views

All extend NetBox generic views — most logic is in the framework.

| Class | Base | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `DiscoveryTargetListView` | `ObjectListView` | Paginated list with filter/search |
| `DiscoveryTargetView` | `ObjectView` | Detail page; adds `recent_runs_table` context |
| `DiscoveryTargetEditView` | `ObjectEditView` | Create/edit form |
| `DiscoveryTargetDeleteView` | `ObjectDeleteView` | Delete confirmation |
| `DiscoveryTargetBulkDeleteView` | `BulkDeleteView` | Bulk delete from list |

### DiscoveryTargetRunView (POST /targets/<pk>/run/)

Enqueues a `DiscoveryJob` for the target. Validates that the target is enabled and has credentials before enqueuing. Redirects to the target detail page with a flash message.

---

## DiscoveryRun Views

| Class | Base | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `DiscoveryRunListView` | `ObjectListView` | Paginated list ordered by `-started_at` |
| `DiscoveryRunView` | `ObjectView` | Detail page; splits `device_results` into created/updated/failed lists for collapsible panels |
| `DiscoveryRunDeleteView` | `ObjectDeleteView` | Delete confirmation |
| `DiscoveryRunBulkDeleteView` | `BulkDeleteView` | Bulk delete |

## How to Change

- **Add a new action to MergeDevicesView**: Add the logic before `keeper.save()` so it's batched into a single save call.
- **Add a new list view for a new model**: Subclass `generic.ObjectListView`, set `queryset`, `table`, `filterset`, `filterset_form`.
- **Add extra context to a detail view**: Override `get_extra_context(self, request, instance)` and return a dict.
